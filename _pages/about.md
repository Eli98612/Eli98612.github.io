I am a Master's student (M.S.) at Binghamton University (SUNY) and a research assistant for the [Digital Data Embedding (DDE)](http://dde.binghamton.edu/) Laboratory. My research focuses on digital media security, in particular Steganography/Steganalysis. I enjoy studying the behavior of digital objects using tools from detection theory and machine/deep learning. My other academic interests include computer graphics and probability theory. I received a B.S. in computer engineering and a B.A. in mathematics from Binghamton University in 2020.

Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf).

    Examples of stego imagesâ€”hover over them to see what's hidden! On the left, a picture of a green door and window is embedded in the 7th and 8th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_plane">bit planes</a>. On the right, a message is embedded by increasing or decreasing pixel values by 1. Pixel changes are shown in white. Changes are frequently made in regions of complex content to make the embedding more secure.
