I am a Master's student (M.S.) at Binghamton University (SUNY) and a research assistant for the [Digital Data Embedding (DDE)](http://dde.binghamton.edu/) Laboratory. My research focuses on digital media security, in particular Steganography/Steganalysis. I enjoy studying the behavior of digital objects using tools from detection theory and machine/deep learning. My other academic interests include computer graphics and probability theory. I received a B.S. in computer engineering and a B.A. in mathematics from Binghamton University in 2020.
